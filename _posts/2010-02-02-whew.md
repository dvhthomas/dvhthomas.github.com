Holy tamales, what a day! I just wrapped up a marathon session getting a new "product" ready for a demo on the east coast (yes, the one that's not the West Coast). I spent all of yesterday struggling with 3rd party vendor software and finally deciding that it sucked and I can do it better myself. So I ripped that stuff out, wrote some handy dandy SQL, and had a WAAAAAAY faster solution by 7:00am this morning.

I fed Lyra and reunited her with her pacifier to grant us some peace and quiet for an additional 30 minutes, and managed to knock out some other bugs that had be...well, bugging me. All before 8:00am :-) And a few hours later it's looking really spiffy. OK, so actually it's not that exciting to look at, just a couple of ASP.NET MVC sites with dead simple controllers. But man, oh man, is the code behind it all sweet. We've got messages, we've got reliability, we've got factories, we've got...whatever: it's freaking cool because it took me ages and the prospective client is going to be very excited when I show them a web page with their logo on it.

The real bottom line is that I can actually look forward to my long flight tomorrow as a time for tweaking and tinkering and polishing the demo rather than sweating my 'nads off while trying to just get the code working.
