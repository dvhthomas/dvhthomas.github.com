I saw [this blog post](http://geekswithblogs.net/alternativedotnet/archive/2009/08/31/134405.aspx) by one of the self-selected Alt.Net crowd about the difference between the treatment of open source in the Java and Microsoft communities. I must say I see this a lot and while I see the value of the support provided by Microsoft, I really have been amazed at the degree to which the Java folks just don't even consider NOT using open source. The Oracle WebLogic Server project I'm looking at now has all kinds of open source software.

I guess the thing I've realized is that even when something like Hibernate or Apache or Eclipse is released under an open source license, some of the very biggest players in the technology world have highly skilled software engineers working on the code. Not because they want to give this stuff away, but because it gives them a competitive advantage in a world where the tool you use is less important than how you use that tool.

Of course this was prompted by me having to write a network trace solver using ArcObjects rather than something simpler like...say...SQL! 1,000 lines of code later and I know know which valves isolate the break in a water main. Ah, the joy of closed source! :-)
