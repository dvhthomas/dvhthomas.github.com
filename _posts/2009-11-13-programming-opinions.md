There's a really [great question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406760/whats-your-most-controversial-programming-opinion/406848) on [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) that appears to be breaking the mold on that front. The contention is that most developers will have a controversial opinion or two up their sleeve. As it happens, many of the "controversial" opinions so far seem to be quite sensible. A couple of my favorites:

## If you only know one language...you're not a great programmer.

More specifically, If you only know one language, no matter how well you know it, you're not a great programmer. There seems to be an attitude that says once you're really good at C# or Java or whatever other language you started out learning then that's all you need. I don't believe it---every language I have ever learned has taught me something new about programming that I have been able to bring back into my work with all the others. I think that anyone who restricts themselves to one language will never be as good as they could be. It also indicates to me a certain lack of inquisitiveness and willingness to experiment that doesn't necessarily tally with the qualities I would expect to find in a really good programmer.

### My Take

Amen! I was just telling Kirk that the only reason my C# is doing as well as it is (I'm modest too) is that I read a lot of Ruby and Python recently. Lambdas and other functional bits like list comprehensions and map/reduce have deepened my understanding of LINQ and the whole Func/Action thing. "I'm a .NET Developer" to me sounds a bit silly. How about "I've done a lot of .NET work but give me a web connection and some good source code to look at and I could do the project in [INSERT LANGUAGE HERE]."

## If you're a developer, you should be able to write code

I did quite a bit of interviewing last year, and for my part of the interview I was supposed to test the way people thought, and how they implemented simple-to-moderate algorithms on a white board. I'd initially started out with questions like:

> Given that Pi can be estimated using the function `4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...)` with more terms giving greater accuracy, write a function that calculates Pi to an accuracy of 5 decimal places.

It's a problem that should make you think, but shouldn't be out of reach to a seasoned developer (it can be answered in about 10 lines of C#). However, many of our (supposedly pre-screened by the agency) candidates couldn't even begin to answer it, or even explain how they might go about answering it. So after a while I started asking simpler questions like:

> Given the area of a circle is given by Pi times the radius squared, write a function to calculate the area of a circle.

Amazingly, more than half the candidates couldn't write this function in any language (I can read most popular languages so I let them use any language of their choice, including pseudo-code). We had "C# developers" who could not write this function in C#. I was surprised by this. I had always thought that developers should be able to write code. It seems that, nowadays, this is a controversial opinion. Certainly it is amongst interview candidates!

### My Take

Jesus!!! I would have crashed and burned on that first one. My math is rudimentary and based upon Google searches. I even bought a beginners guide to pre-calculus recently. Yes, we need to be able to write code, but lets stick to realistic problems. I'm much more likely to ask a question like the FizzBuzz one, or ask a candidate to walk me through pseudo code for an elevator control system. If they can actually THINK through that design exercise then I can teach them how to code it.

So yeah, that's a really thought provoking question that has spawing lots of interesting discussion. Have a troll through the responses and let me know what you think is "controversial" and what is just common sense.
