I'm rereading [Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman](http://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044) by James Gleick this week. Incidentally he’s written another one of my favorite books, [Chaos: Making a New Science](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Making-Science-James-Gleick/dp/0143113453/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_k2a_2_txt?pf_rd_p=304485601&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-2&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0140092501&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=15DPBWNCVV686K13DHDY) which was originally written in 1988 and just republished last year. If you enjoy popular science writing Chaos is a great read. Anyway, back to _Genius_.

One of the things I frequently find myself doing when I’m at the early stages of a software development project is staring at the wall for an hour at a time. Literally an hour plus. I read up on the “literature” which entails a ton of blog posts, maybe some best practices described by the software vendor or open source folks that who’s package I’m using, and then talking with my colleagues. After that research I try to internalize what goals the software has to achieve and then the wall-staring begins. If I were to try to describe what I “see”, it’s like a collection of boxes of different colors floating around and forming connections with each other. The connections have different thicknesses and sort of pulsate with light when I feel there’s a good link between two things, or when there are signals or messages between them. Finally, as things settle down and I get closer to a starting point (where I could write a little code) the boxes start to crystallize like the water-to-ice phase transition and a more rigid structure emerges. And then I crack open my coding tool and start typing frantically before I forget what I just thought out…only to discover it was crap and I begin the process again but with a slightly different set of beginning assumptions.

Can you believe what I do for a living? :-)

Anyway, I am always interested to hear how other people deal with this visualization issue for things that don’t really have a physical, visual representation. This morning I re-read a great quotation of Feynman, the Nobel winning theoretical physicist and bongo drum player as he attempts to describe his approach to visualizing the impossible:

> What I am really trying to do is being birth to clarity, which is really a half-assedly thought-out pictorial semi-vision thing. I would see the jiggle-jiggle or the wiggle of the path. Even now when I talk about the influence functional, I see the coupling and I take this turn—like as if there was a big bag of stuff—and try to collect it away and to push it. It’s all visual. It’s hard to explain.

Isn’t that just the best description ever of a visual thought process? It completely captures the indescribable nature of how we intuitive think about complex processes that really are difficult to describe. For a physicist it’s the way that you think about E- and B-fields and electron paths; for software developers it’s the admittedly much easier design process. The end result is something concrete: a set of equations or a class diagram which are blueprints for reproducing what’s going on inside our heads. But what I love about it is the leveling of the playing field because I think all of us go through the visualization process when we’re working on something that is hard to put down on paper until we have the final answer.
