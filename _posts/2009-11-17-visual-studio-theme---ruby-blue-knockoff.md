In the "can't possibly face another line of code" category for today I spent a few minutes changing colors in Visual Studio. It's not exactly rocket science but sometimes you just need to do something different to refresh the brain cells. I kind of like this darker-but-not-black look to reduce eye strain. It's a total knockoff of John Long's [TextMate theme](http://wiseheartdesign.com/articles/2006/03/11/ruby-blue-textmate-theme/). [Download the theme](http://gist.github.com/236449) from GitHub and using your `Import/Export Settings` option to pull them in. I just exported the colors and fonts so you should not see any other settings change.

UPDATE: And you can probably tell that I like the [Monaco](http://www.webdevkungfu.com/textmate-envy-aka-monaco-font-for-windows) font for my fixed-width viewing pleasure.
