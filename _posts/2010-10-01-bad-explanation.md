I have officially discovered the worst slide describing REST. Not because the explanation itself is particularly poor. But the visual noise is just too much to bear. I actually stopped watching [the presentation](http://mediacast.sun.com/users/caroljmcdonald/media/restproject.swf) immediately. Here's the offending slide at 0:21.

To be fair, REST is the most hopelessly misunderstood and poorly implemented 'standard', but I like to think that I could do a bit better than this.
